# Foreword

In this document we will describe how to use the OmniPaxos library. We then continue with a detailed tutorial for both local and distributed deployments of the OmniPaxos implementation in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language.

In addition to the tutorial style presentation in this book, many examples of OmniPaxos uses can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/haraldng/omnipaxos/tree/master/tests).
