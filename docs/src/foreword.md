# Foreword

In this document we will describe how to use the Kompact component-actor hybrid framework. We begin by introducing the model, which is novel in its hybrid nature, but should feel sufficiently familiar to previous users of other Actor frameworks (such as [Akka](https://akka.io/), for example) or [Kompics](https://kompics.github.io/kompics-scala/) implementations. We then continue with a detailed tutorial for both local and distributed deployments of the Kompact implementation in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language.

In addition to the tutorial style presentation in this book, many examples of Kompact uses can be found in the [docs](https://docs.rs/kompact/latest/kompact/) and in the [benchmarks](https://github.com/kompics/kompicsbenches/tree/master/kompact).
